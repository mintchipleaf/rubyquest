            Good idea. Ruby and Tom both make sure their radios are on.<br/>Ruby quickly climbs down into the brig, which is still as broken as ever, and darts into the side room.<br/>There, she finally replaces the wooden EYE PEG and dials it to the symbol that corresponds to the console she used when she first woke up.
