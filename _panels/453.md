            Tom agrees. He was just trying to be upbeat.<div class="linebreak"></div>The champagne will taste all the better when they're out of here.<div class="linebreak"></div>Ruby inspects the objects on the wall. She finds, on the shelf, two WALKIE-TALKIES. Both Tom and Ruby take one.<div class="linebreak"></div>YOU CAN NOW DIRECTLY CONTROL TOM.<div class="linebreak"></div>FROM NOW ON, SPECIFY WHICH CHARACTER YOU ARE DIRECTING YOUR ACTION TO. YOU CAN STILL HAVE ONE CHARACTER TELL THE OTHER TO DO SOMETHING, OR YOU CAN SIMPLY COMMAND THAT CHARACTER DIRECTLY.
