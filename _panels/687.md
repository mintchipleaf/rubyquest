            Well fine. Put him in one of the lockers and close it then. If we're going to be hostile towards poor Stitches the least we can do is keep him from wandering around the facility.

            Stitches is carrying a TINY KEY labelled "medicine cabinet" in tiny letters. <div class="linebreak"></div>...Tom decides to leave it with him.<div class="linebreak"></div>Tom shoves Stitches into Locker #5 and slams the door close hard enough to jam it on the hinges. It's not much, but it'll do for now. It should keep him safe, and he should be out for a while with all the tranq Tom used.
