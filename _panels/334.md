            <br/>The thick metal shutters on the Z-Hatch are WAY too strong for Ruby to pry open!<br/><br/>

            <br/>The lock is surprisingly resilient, but Ruby knew this already. Maybe it's not so surprising.<br/><br/>

            <br/>Ruby RAPIDLY returns to the boarded-up hole, but she's not strong enough to pry the boards free! Her GIRLISH FIGURE is just not up to the task. She very rapidly returns to the other side -- how considerate of her!<br/><br/>

            <br/>Ruby heads west!
