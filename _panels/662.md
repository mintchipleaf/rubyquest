            The light fades from the room and darkness envelops Ruby and Tom. It is a familiar and horrible kind of darkness. <div class="linebreak"></div>The unrelenting sound of moving water deafens their ears. <div class="linebreak"></div>You can suggest actions for both Ruby and Tom, though neither is sure exactly where the other is.<div class="linebreak"></div>[As always, please try to self-moderate and avoid flooding the thread with repeat comments. The faster you fill up a thread, the sooner a new one will have to be started, so please be considerate of others.<div class="linebreak"></div>For running discussion, visit the IRC room at irc.rizon.net and /join #rubyquest .]
