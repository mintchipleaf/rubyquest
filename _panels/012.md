            Ruby has no magical or otherwise extraordinary powers. She has no knowledge of where she is or how she got here, and though she is not a specialist and holds no particularly special knowledge she is reasonably competent with things most people would be.<div class="linebreak"></div>Her physical capabilities are varied. She's limber, in good shape, but not particularly strong.<div class="linebreak"></div>She is currently carrying:<div class="linebreak"></div>CAN-OPENER<div class="linebreak"></div>BARE LENGTH OF WIRE<div class="linebreak"></div>
