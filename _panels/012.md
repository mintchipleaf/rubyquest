            <br/>Damn, if we had a cell phone we could call Tank and have him upload hacking knowledge into Ruby's head.<br/><br/>Okay, first off, can I get a loadout of all of Ruby's abilities, general knowledges, and physical capabilities?

            <br/>Ruby has no magical or otherwise extraordinary powers. She has no knowledge of where she is or how she got here, and though she is not a specialist and holds no particularly special knowledge she is reasonably competent with things most people would be.<br/>Her physical capabilities are varied. She's limber, in good shape, but not particularly strong.<br/>She is currently carrying:<br/>CAN-OPENER<br/>BARE LENGTH OF WIRE<br/><br/>

            <br/>Ruby is above such primitive practices as chewing on wire and cannibalizing her young. If she had any.<br/>And besides, that would not be productive right now!
