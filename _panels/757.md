            Tom: "Ah, I get it. You're going to say 'You're trapped!' or some trite little villain's commonplace, aren't you? No such luck. YOU'RE the one that's trapped. Trapped in your obsession, bound to your two little playthings, feeding and washing and slavishly cleaning up after what are 'supposed' to be pets. You don't run this game. There's no referee. It's the game of life, and in your conceited, pathetic, smallminded way, YOU. JUST. LOST."
