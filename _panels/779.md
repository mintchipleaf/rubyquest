            Tom attempts to make contact with whoever's on the other end.

            A strangely familiar voice fires off a string of incredibly foul (and very unprovoked) profanities directed at Tom.

            Tom pauses momentarily, stunned by the response. Just as he attempts to explain his situation, a strange crunching sound -- like something being eaten -- comes from the other end, followed by static.

            It would appear the line is now dead.
