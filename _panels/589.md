            Tom is scared and angry.
            Ruby fumbles for an explanation, an apology -- anything. She assures Tom she would never hurt him. There's nothing wrong with her, and if there was, she's better now.

            She doesn't want to hurt him.

            IRC chatroom for ongoing discussion at irc.rizon.net , /join #rubyquest .
            As per usual, I'd like to request people not spam suggestions or make unnecessary "seconding this" posts, avoid overposting, and generally try to self-moderate. Remember, the more the thread gets flooded, the harder it is to keep up, and the slower things will go.
            Thanks for your help. Hope you enjoy.]
