            Tom is scared and angry.<br/>Ruby fumbles for an explanation, an apology -- anything. She assures Tom she would never hurt him. There's nothing wrong with her, and if there was, she's better now.<br/><br/>She doesn't want to hurt him. <br/><br/>[archives here: http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?tags=Ruby<br/>IRC chatroom for ongoing discussion at irc.rizon.net , /join #rubyquest .<br/>As per usual, I'd like to request people not spam suggestions or make unnecessary "seconding this" posts, avoid overposting, and generally try to self-moderate. Remember, the more the thread gets flooded, the harder it is to keep up, and the slower things will go.<br/>Thanks for your help. Hope you enjoy.]
