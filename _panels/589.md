There's nothing wrong with her, and if there was, she's better now.<div class="linebreak"></div>She doesn't want to hurt him. <div class="linebreak"></div>[archives here: http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?tags=Ruby<div class="linebreak"></div>IRC chatroom for ongoing discussion at irc.rizon.net , /join #rubyquest .<div class="linebreak"></div>As per usual, I'd like to request people not spam suggestions or make unnecessary "seconding this" posts, avoid overposting, and generally try to self-moderate.
