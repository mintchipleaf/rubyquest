            All right, so I'm not perfect. Which would you prefer, accuracy or speed? I'm doing my best to keep up with you guys.<div class="linebreak"></div>I'm trying to keep the plot moving forward and I'm doing the best I've can. Lots of solutions so far haven't been what I've planned and numerous things weren't even decided on until you guys made the decision.<div class="linebreak"></div>I'm doing my best here, if you don't like it,  fuck off. Your plan is stupid, and my choices are either to respond to EVERY COMMAND someone enters and explain why it doesn't work or isn't being used, or I can just continue on with the ideas that DO move the story along or at least provide some sort of interesting narrative.<div class="linebreak"></div>Now let's move on.
