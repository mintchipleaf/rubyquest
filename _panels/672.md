            Hug Tom.<br/><br/>If the danger's gone, now would be a good time to investigate Red's room again: Judging from how Ace can move around, the debris there should've been cleaned and allow movement for Ruby and Tom as well.

            <br/>Tom politely explains he doesn't feel like hugging Ruby right now, given the footage they watched together a short while ago. That hug didn't end particularly well.<br/>Maybe they just need some time to trust each other again.<br/><br/>The blood on the fan is most likely a spot the cleaners missed after the "accident" Ruby made Stitches have in the fan.<br/><br/>

            <br/>The lock is massive and sturdy. No way even Tom's MANLY PHYSIQUE could tear it down!<br/><br/>

            <br/>Ruby checks the plant, but it doesn't appear to be anything but a plant and some soil.
