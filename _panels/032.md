            Ruby descends down the access shaft's ladder. <div class="linebreak"></div>Congratulations! You've escaped the first room!<div class="linebreak"></div>[From here on out the adventure may slow down a bit as I don't have anything at all drawn (e.g. scenery, objects, interface, key shots, etc.) after this point. We're breaking brand new ground here. <div class="linebreak"></div>We're not stopping, though! Keep the commands coming and I'll do my best to keep up with Ruby's story.]
