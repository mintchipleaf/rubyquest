            Ruby descends down the access shaft's ladder. 
            Congratulations! You've escaped the first room!

            [From here on out the adventure may slow down a bit as I don't have anything at all drawn (e.g. scenery, objects, interface, key shots, etc.) after this point. We're breaking brand new ground here. 
            We're not stopping, though! Keep the commands coming and I'll do my best to keep up with Ruby's story.]
