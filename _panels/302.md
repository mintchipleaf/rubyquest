            Examine the bin, the place where her locker used to be, close the z-hatch with the computer. look down the shaft where we pushed the barrel through. look at that blobby thing.

            There's a utilitarian metal hamper here. Something is inside. Ruby decides to get it. One moment.<br/>There's a pit in the center of the room, spattered with dried blood. Sitting in the center is a scrap of paper. Ruby will pick that up in just a second, too.<br/>The hatch in the southeast corner has a ladder, and looking down, it appears to lead into the cell room below. Something about that fact seems odd.<br/>The corner has some sort of strange, smooth organic growth latched onto two walls and the floor. <br/>It looks almost like skin.
