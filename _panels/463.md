            Wasn't there an entrance next to RED's hideout?

            <br/>The room with Red's hideout and the monitors is blocked by a collapse of debris! Both that room and the room with the bomb are inaccessible, at least for now!<br/><br/>The consensus seems to be either to go upstairs or go to the boarded-up hole in the other room.<br/>Who should go where? Remember, now that they have walkie-talkies they can split up and work faster while staying in touch!<br/><br/>WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?
