            <br/>There is a patient's stool in the southwest corner. It doesn't open.<br/>Against the north wall in what appears to be the examination portion of the room, there is some sort of metal footlocker overgrown with fleshy protuberances.<br/><br/>It resists Tom's attempts to open it, and two long, fleshy growths seem to converge where the lock would normally be, reaching towards each other with a gap in between.<br/><br/>The entire thing seems like an amalgamation of skin, muscle, and vein.
