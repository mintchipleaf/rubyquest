            There's a circuitboard on the east wall. It appears to be missing a square component, but no wires are damaged.
            Above it is a closed vent.
            There's a device containing purple liquid, with a sort of pluglike hole set it in, and beneath that, drips of purple. There's no visible faucet to remove the liquid.
            There's what appears to be a pneumatic tube running through the ceiling with a small compartment here.
            There's a metal transfer compartment in the wall, like a bank deposit drawer.
            There's a strange device near the west wall with an LED readout that says "sample", but has no obvious buttons, controls, or instructions beyond that.
