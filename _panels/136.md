            There's a circuitboard on the east wall. It appears to be missing a square component, but no wires are damaged.<br/>Above it is a closed vent.<br/>There's a device containing purple liquid, with a sort of pluglike hole set it in, and beneath that, drips of purple. There's no visible faucet to remove the liquid.<br/>There's what appears to be a pneumatic tube running through the ceiling with a small compartment here.<br/>There's a metal transfer compartment in the wall, like a bank deposit drawer.<br/>There's a strange device near the west wall with an LED readout that says "sample", but has no obvious buttons, controls, or instructions beyond that.
