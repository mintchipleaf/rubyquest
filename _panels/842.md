            Out of pity, Ruby tries to call to Subject Six, but it's no good. He sits shivering in his grief, muttering to himself in fear of Ace.<br/>Ruby enters the Lobby. The ex-prisoner seems to have regained some of his motor skills and is shakily climbing the now-open ladder upwards. Tom says his name is "Jay".<br/>Tom is visibly shaken. If that giant monster is afraid of Ace, he doesn't stand a chance, even if he were to manage another burst of adrenaline.
