            Tom knocks.
            RED'S voice comes from the other side, raspy and strangely excited.

            "HOLD ON NOW, FRIENDS.
            RED CAN'T LET JUST ANYONE THROUGH THIS DOOR.
            YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOU'RE FAMILY.
            PART OF 
            RED'S 
            SPECIAL FAMILY."
