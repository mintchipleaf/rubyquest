            Well, that's the true end, everyone. <br/>I hope you had as much fun playing as I did running this little campaign for you.<br/><br/>It's been a long run but it's finally over. All stories have to come to an end sooner or later.<br/><br/>Thanks for your patience, your support, and your encouragement. It's been a blast.<br/><br/>Also: Some people have been asking to donate, and I'm a little hesitant to accept free money from strangers but if you honestly feel like just throwing money at me I am not too proud to accept it. If you weren't going to or think it's a ridiculous idea then please continue as you were. <br/>For the few crazy people who think this was somehow worth money, I'm flattered, just drop me a PM on IRC.
