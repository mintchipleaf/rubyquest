            <br/>There's a strange circular thing on the wall opposite the broken window/mirror, which looks almost like a clock. There are no hands, but there is a circular peg in the center.<br/>There are no numbers, only four odd symbols.<br/><br/>

            <br/>The window is still too small for Ruby to fit through, and even if she could, it's lined with sharp broken plate glass.
