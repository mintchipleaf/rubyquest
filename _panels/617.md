            Ruby enters the hidden room.
            This room is divided into two main sections by a partition wall with no door, leaving both sections separated but accessible.
            It appears to be similar to the examination room downstairs, in some ways.

            An ACCESS HATCH leading up is sealed with a rather large mechanism, which is linked to a wall panel. 

            On the west portion of the room, there is a MEDICINE CABINET.
