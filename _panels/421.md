            Red face is grotesquely deformed, with an impossibly huge grin.<br/>Red is impaled through the back of his neck and through the right side of his skull by large stakes. Red is covered in blood and not moving. <br/>Red's dead, baby.<br/><br/>Ruby doesn't particularly want to disturb Red's body, let alone pull out thick wooden stakes jammed through his gray matter.<br/><br/>TOM examines the METAL BOX Red left. It appears unlocked, so he opens it.
