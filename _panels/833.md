            While Ruby waits for the system to respond, Tom runs into FILBERT. Apparently he shook off a massive dose of tranquilizer rather quickly. He menaces with spikes of flesh at Tom. He seems even more ravenously determined than last time, eager to rip Tom to pieces.<div class="linebreak"></div>This is the last thing he needed. He's got to get to the exit.<div class="linebreak"></div>Tom doesn't fucking have TIME for this!
