            <br/>While Ruby waits for the system to respond, Tom runs into FILBERT. Apparently he shook off a massive dose of tranquilizer rather quickly. He menaces with spikes of flesh at Tom. He seems even more ravenously determined than last time, eager to rip Tom to pieces.<br/><br/>This is the last thing he needed. He's got to get to the exit.<br/>Tom doesn't fucking have TIME for this!
