            Not only would a saw made of razor-sharp barrel-metal and bare wire be INCREDIBLY dangerous to use in ANY way, it certainly wouldn't have the durability or control to cut through these bars, which appear to be a stronger metal than the barrel anyway.<br/>You do get +1 INGENUITY for your idea though.
