            Ruby shoots the monitor the bird and it goes back to static.<br/><br/>She radios Tom, and tells him everything that just happened.<br/>Filbert, the "infection" on which even Filbert's account contradicts itself, Ace's obedience, and whoever SHE is. <br/>Tom tells Ruby to go on ahead. There's something he needs to check first, but he'll meet up with her again shortly.<br/><br/>It sounds as though Tom is ready to try working together again.
