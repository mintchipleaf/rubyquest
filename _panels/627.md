            Filbert turns, suddenly angry, and lays it all out.

            Ruby already HAS the cure. So does everyone else in this facility.
            It brought her SIGHT. It made her WELL. She didn't even need to EAT or DRINK.

            But when she died, she fucked it up.
            The cure was strong. It brought her BACK. And when she came back 
            she brought something with her.

            Filbert is the only one left untouched. He has to escape. He demands the PASSCODE.
