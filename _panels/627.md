            <br/>Filbert turns, suddenly angry, and lays it all out.<br/><br/>Ruby already HAS the cure. So does everyone else in this facility.<br/>It brought her SIGHT. It made her WELL. She didn't even need to EAT or DRINK.<br/><br/>But when she died, she fucked it up.<br/>The cure was strong. It brought her BACK. And when she came back <br/>she brought something with her.<br/><br/>Filbert is the only one left untouched. He has to escape. He demands the PASSCODE.
