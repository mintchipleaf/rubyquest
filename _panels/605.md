            Anyone else notice that the fist was suspiciously suggested out of fucking NOWHERE and now it suddenly needed to be used to progress?

            Why doesn't Weaver just post all the panels of the comic together with the story in text?  I'm sure we'd like it more because a. we wouldn't be spending so much time/clogging the thread posting suggestions for no reason and b. if we could just read the story all in one go, people wouldn't be so angry about it.

            The fist was not needed to tear the parchment. Ruby is not THAT weak.
