            Filbert emerges from the large tube, wielding a BONESAW. He demands that Ruby and Tom, being so clearly infected, must be operated on immediately. He says he will cut them until they are clean.<br/>It would appear Filbert is rather adamant about this.<br/>It would also appear he's gone completely off his head.<br/>[As always, try to keep most running discussion to the IRC room at irc.rizon.net , /join #rubyquest , so as to avoid cluttering the threads too much. Just practice a little self-moderation and try not to flood things.]
