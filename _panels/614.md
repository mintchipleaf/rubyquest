            <br/>Ruby checks the various lockers.<br/>Most of them are jammed shut, and locker #5 is wedged on its hinges. It looks like it was shut too tightly -- Ruby can't pull it open with her GIRLISH FIGURE.<br/><br/>There is fresh blood on locker 2, however, and the locking mechanism seems to be open.<br/>Ruby considers whether to investigate.
