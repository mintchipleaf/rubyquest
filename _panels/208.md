            [I'd just like to make one request: these are much easier to manage when threads are kept to only what's needed, so to avoid having to make 8+ threads per adventure, try to keep comments relevant. If you have something to speculate, post it along with your suggestion of action, or otherwise try to keep from overposting. 30 posts per action is a bit much, especially when not many options are available. 
            Basically, all I'm asking is that everyone tries to avoid flooding these threads unnecessarily.]

            Ruby pockets the COPPER KEY.
