            Tell Ruby to inspect the sign. The middle one is electrocution, the second from the right has a grate sign, the one after has an arrow, but I don't know the other two. The one of the second left is death so avoid that and I'm guessing the far left is water. Tell Tom to press the one, from his side, the second from the left for him which will be the second from the right on this side saying the grate.

            Inspect what looks like a safe on the wall in this room.

            Inspect what looks like a portrait of a fish on this side of the room.

            Look through what looks like a grate in the door to the left of the room.

            The slot in the door is closed, and appears to be opened only from the other side.

            It looks like an eye, actually.
