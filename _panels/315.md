            Tom looks like he feels better.<br/><br/>Ruby tells Tom what's happened. Tom explains he's been weak and despondent lately, and unfortunately can't help her with many details, except that the western door in the room with the big console (the one that the fishtank-door leads to) is the way into the room he was trapped in.<br/><br/>They both agree that the only thing to do now is go forward.
