            Tom and Ruby make a boring excursion back downstairs, through the Z-Hatch, unplug the cord, pull it back to the proper side, change the dial to the symbol in the water, then climb back upstairs. <div class="linebreak"></div>But it's very boring so let's just skip all that and get to the good part. It's what Ruby would want. She doesn't mess around.
