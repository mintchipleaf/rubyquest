            uhh, i'm not real sure if this is an ass-hole move or not, if so please forgive, but i know a chatroom you can use, there is NEVER anyone there because it isn't on any websites, you don't have to sign in, or get an account or anything, the only problem is, that you, weaver, would have to put your pics on imagedump, then post the link, but there is no limits, and no mod either, so...          http://wootspamhouse.chatango.com/                  again, if this is an ass-hole thing to say, just ignore me and my retardedness...

            Checked and it hasn't been done yet.<br/><br/>Look outside the broken window and see if anything is outside.  <br/><br/>Question:  Could Ruby attempt to remove the nails holding the tarp by standing on the "Do Not Open" box and remove the nails with the coins?

            [RUBY DISCUSSION:<br/>I've actually already made a room to discuss Ruby, but I guess no one saw it. <br/>Fire up an IRC client and hop onto irc.rizon.net , then /join #RubyQuest . <br/>It should be easy enough. You can keep a running discussion of the game there, plus speculate, react, and whatever else, while keeping the actions (and relevant, reasonably-sized discussion of them as suggested) in this thread.<br/>Should provide a better medium for discussion while simultaneously freeing up this thread for space.]<br/><br/>

            <br/>The nails aren't in all the way, so they can't be pried with the coins, but despite her strongest efforts, they still refuse to be pulled out of the wall with Ruby's bare hands.
