            Before Ruby's eyes, the fleshy growths grow together and coil into one another.<br/><br/>The large fleshy mass Ruby placed onto the chest, now connected, begins to beat rhythmically, expanding and contracting with a soft, wet sound.<br/><br/>A moment later, the lid of the locker opens up -- not from the edge, but from the center, peeling itself open.<br/>From inside, Ruby retrieves a FLESHY PROTOTUBE, a bizarre organic item that somehow features an electrical contact panel on one end.
