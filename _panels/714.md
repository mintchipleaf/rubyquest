            Check that wall painting with your third eye, Ruby. It might be important.
      text: >-
            <br/>Ruby examines the room with her THIRD EYE.<br/><br/>Something painful emanates from the PAINTING. But it's hollow, distant. Like an echo of something, memories of before.

            A second echo suddenly comes through, piercingly.<br/>It's small, and it's just an echo, but it's still incredibly focused, overpoweringly potent.
