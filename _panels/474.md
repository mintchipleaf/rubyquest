            Tom inspects the ANATOMICAL EYE MODEL, it's just a plastic standee model of an eyeball, like the kind they have in medical schools.<br/>HOWEVER! When Tom picks it up, he finds a single COIN underneath the base, which he then pockets.<br/>The DIAGRAM in the back is that of an eye with some sort of strange script annotating it. It seems very archaic.<br/>Tom picks up the PAPERS on the exam table...<br/>[CUTSCENE moment, give me a minute to draw the papers and such]
