            Tom inspects the ANATOMICAL EYE MODEL, it's just a plastic standee model of an eyeball, like the kind they have in medical schools.
            HOWEVER! When Tom picks it up, he finds a single COIN underneath the base, which he then pockets.

            The DIAGRAM in the back is that of an eye with some sort of strange script annotating it. It seems very archaic.

            Tom picks up the PAPERS on the exam table...
            [CUTSCENE moment, give me a minute to draw the papers and such]
