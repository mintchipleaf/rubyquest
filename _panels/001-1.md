            In light of the apparent fact that interactive adventures are acceptable here, I've decided to continue Ruby here. For those who already saw the first part back when I had to post it on /r9k/, hopefully you'll just bear with me on this one and not provide any undue spoilers until we're past the end of the last one. A flood of /b/tards migrating from their dying board sort of put a damper on that attempt.

            So, get out your parser interface and let's see what we can do here.
