            Ruby and Tom head towards land as the tram slowly crosses the land bridge.
            Jay sleeps at the fore of the tram, recovering from his ordeal.

            Tom tosses away all the NOTES he's been collecting. He is happy just to be alive.
            He never wants to READ another NOTE as long as he lives.
