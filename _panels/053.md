            Ok, middle is electrocute, as Tom knows, left of middle is death, so don't press that, left of death is either fire or water so let's not press that either, right of middle is grating, could open the cell or close the z-hatch, have Tom push that one, right of grating is down arrow, it could lower the bars or lower the ceiling so have Tom push that if the grating button doesn't work.

            You bring the diagram to Tom. He is already starting to trust you, and with the added incentive that only one "electrocution" symbol is present on the diagram, you manage to convince him the other buttons will not administer shocks. <div class="linebreak"></div>It's time to choose.<div class="linebreak"></div>What button should Tom press?
