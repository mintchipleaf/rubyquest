            Let's consider the strength of the bomb. Has this perhaps altered our other surroundings? We may want to check some other rooms to see if they've been affected, mainly the bottom half of the tube.

            <br/>The explosions seems quite localized -- the door to the north is inaccessible, and most likely, the room the explosion took place in is all but obliterated, but it seems most of the other rooms are unaffected. The area as a whole does not seem to have had a particularly strong reaction.
