            Wasn't there an entrance next to RED's hideout?

            The room with Red's hideout and the monitors is blocked by a collapse of debris! Both that room and the room with the bomb are inaccessible, at least for now!<div class="linebreak"></div>The consensus seems to be either to go upstairs or go to the boarded-up hole in the other room.<div class="linebreak"></div>Who should go where? Remember, now that they have walkie-talkies they can split up and work faster while staying in touch!<div class="linebreak"></div>WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?
