            Wasn't there an entrance next to RED's hideout?
    text: |-
            The room with Red's hideout and the monitors is blocked by a collapse of debris! Both that room and the room with the bomb are inaccessible, at least for now!

            The consensus seems to be either to go upstairs or go to the boarded-up hole in the other room.
            Who should go where? Remember, now that they have walkie-talkies they can split up and work faster while staying in touch!

            WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?
