            Ruby gives Tom the FIRST AID KIT, which Tom unlocks with the SEVERED FINGER.

            He empties it for its contents, which turn out to be:
            A pair of WIRE CUTTERS
            A ROLL OF GAUZE
            And a STRANGE DISC of green-dyed wood. It looks like it was broken off of something.
