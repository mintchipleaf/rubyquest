            Oh come on, I've been doing this for over ten hours (eleven if you count initial prep time), starting just before midnight. It's now 10:30 AM. <br/>I haven't slept.<br/>And besides, I figured this was a great stopping point. You achieved your biggest goal yet, it's not right in the middle of the action or a big decision...<br/>Come on, admit it. Of all the places in the story I could have stopped, this has the most closure so far.
