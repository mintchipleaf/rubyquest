            There's a CEREAL BOX under Red's tent.<div class="linebreak"></div>On the wall, among endless scrawls of illegible, fevered writings, there's some sort of crude, arcane circular diagram, and in the center, a relatively-fresh bloodstain, probably from some time in the last few days.<div class="linebreak"></div>Looks like someone hit their head here. Very hard.
