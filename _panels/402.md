            Analyze object under the tent thing, then the bloody hole in the wall.
    text: |-
            There's a CEREAL BOX under Red's tent.
            On the wall, among endless scrawls of illegible, fevered writings, there's some sort of crude, arcane circular diagram, and in the center, a relatively-fresh bloodstain, probably from some time in the last few days.
            Looks like someone hit their head here. Very hard.
