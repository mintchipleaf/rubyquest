            Ruby asks the face who it is.<div class="linebreak"></div>The screen goes to static.<div class="linebreak"></div>Ruby and Tom move on to explore the room.<div class="linebreak"></div>This room is full of broken science equipment, including shattered beakers and tubes, a broken table in the southeast corner, and lots of spilled liquid. The room spells of chemical vapors.<div class="linebreak"></div>Tom can see something vaguely through the steel vent, but it's too sturdy to bash down by brute force.<div class="linebreak"></div>There are scraps and tatters of cloth at Tom's feet. They look like the remnants of a labcoat.<div class="linebreak"></div>By a very LARGE CABINET (which is locked with a chain and padlock), Ruby finds a SEVERED FOOT on the ground, with minimal blood.<div class="linebreak"></div>The door has no visible lock, but is wired to the MONITOR.<div class="linebreak"></div>Ruby pockets the HEAVY GLOVES she finds on the floor.<div class="linebreak"></div>Also of obvious note in this room is the ACCESS HATCH leading down, which is secured in place with some sort of STAFF.
