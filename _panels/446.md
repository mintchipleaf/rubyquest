            <br/>[C-C-C-C-C-COMBO<br/>Okay, calm down, post a little slower, you know I'm getting to it.]<br/><br/>Tom and Ruby inspect the room.<br/>There is a bottle of CHAMPAGNE on the table. Tom takes it.<br/>There is a NOTE on the other table. Ruby will inspect that in just a moment.<br/>On the north wall is the doorway to the room the bomb went off in. The heavy door has been blown to pieces but seemed to protect this room rather well from the blast. The doorway is marked "Holding" by a sign above it.<br/><br/>There is a WATER COOLER here.<br/>Beside the cooler, there is a set of METAL SHUTTERS, which are wrapped shut at the base with barbed wire.
