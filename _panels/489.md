            Ruby should tell her name. She heard Stitches speak it before. Tom should grab the key and run back to Ruby. Trying to see where the cable goes will result only in sanity loss.

            <br/>Ruby tells Stitches her name.<br/><br/>Stitches freezes. Again, he stutters.<br/>"H-HOW DO I KNOW Y--Y-Y-YOU?"<br/><br/>He appears to prepare an attack, then suddenly turns and flees from the closet, wailing a rattling moan.<br/>"STAY AWAY FROM ME," he shrieks. "I--I-I'LL ONLY HURT YOU!"<br/><br/>With that, Stitches is gone.
