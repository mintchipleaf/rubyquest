            Tom takes a moment to reflect on how tragic it is that sometimes actions have to have consequences, good or bad. 

            Ruby is relieved beyond words that Tom made it up. She's also glad she saw him coming up before she slammed the hatch shut.

            Tom and Ruby close the door behind them.
