            The keypad linked to the access hatch in the ceiling is a strange one. <div class="linebreak"></div>It has a digit-lock AND a swipe-card slot, and it appears to be lacking power.<div class="linebreak"></div>Strangely, it is connected to the hatch with both an electric and apparently-organic cord. The fleshy cord reaches from one terminal to the hatch, as does an electrical wire. Crossing the electrical wire is a thing flap of burnt flesh and ash, which appears to be leading to the a set of contacts on the access card reader. <div class="linebreak"></div>It seems rather complex. Whatever the case, the burnt flesh appears to be evidence that the two cords have trouble working well together.
