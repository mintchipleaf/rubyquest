            Thanks for bearing with me, folks. It's been a fun TEN STRAIGHT HOURS I've been doing this (+2 hours prep beforehand for room design/drawing).<br/>I'm sure you've already noticed I'm not particularly artistic, nor a particularly quick-draw. Today's portion of the adventure was fun, I learned some things about my limits (e.g. avoid action scenes like the monster fight, that took up a whole goddamn thread, even though most of it was the 40+ responses per image), and we made some progress.<br/>I've been trying to give people more freedom with their actions since a lot of people were accusing me of railroading early on, so I hope that was a bit more fun as well.<br/><br/>Don't worry, Ruby's story isn't over yet. There's still more to come, soon enough.<br/>Thanks for your support, /tg/.
