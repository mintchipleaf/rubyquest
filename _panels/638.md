            <br/>Ruby re-locks the padlocked door.<br/><br/>Filbert appears on the monitor.<br/>He shouts angrily at Ruby.<br/>He says he is the only one CLEAN. He is the only one who can ESCAPE. The others have damned themselves.<br/>He says ACE will get her. Ace won't listen to his orders anymore -- he won't even listen to HER. But he is still obedient. Filbert doesn't know who, but he knows he is still listening to SOMEONE.<br/>He says Ace will GET Ruby.
