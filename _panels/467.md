            <br/>The door on the right is unlocked. It opens into a small closet. On the north wall is a large glass-front installment, like a vending machine, filled with all manner of pills and medicinal vials.<br/>There are two shelves here. On one shelf is a HIGH-TECH FIRST AID KIT. On the shelf above it is a PRESSURIZED OXYGEN TANK with an oxygen mask attached.
