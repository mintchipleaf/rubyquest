            FROM NOW ON, commands should be specific. Because Ruby is the protagonist, your actions are through her. It is assumed any action will be directed at Ruby. FROM NOW ON, actions will not assume to be shared, so "go downstairs" will result in only Ruby going downstairs. Alternately you could "Tell Tom to go downstairs" or "Go downstairs with Tom".<br/>Ruby heads back to the room beyond the Z-hatch.
