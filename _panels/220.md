            Carefully take a piece of glass from the window (or broken lying around) and slice open and cut the  dummy apart. From the pieces see if we can fashion any tools maybe?

            [You don't need to go THAT far, it's just that everyone reading seems to want to post the next action, even when it's something obvious like "go through door" that everyone else is bound to post, so we get 20 at the same time saying the same thing.<div class="linebreak"></div>I guess it's just that everyone thinks if they don't say it, no one will. That's fine for obscure actions or clever uses, but for things like "use key on lock", it's been said like 20+ times already.]<div class="linebreak"></div>

            Ruby's palm doesn't work. The machine beeps once with a very incorrect-sounding beep, and a tiny red light blinks a few times.<div class="linebreak"></div>

            Ouch!<div class="linebreak"></div>The glass is too dangerously sharp to use as a tool, and the dummy's exterior is thick and padded. Ruby's skin gives way before the dummy's and she accidentally cuts her palm with the glass.
