            Intended to remove an extraneous piece of clothing for the sake of hand-protection
      text: >-
            Ruby doesn't have enough clothing on for anything to really be considered extraneous.<br/>
    - command: >-
            Enter command, "open locker"
      text: >-
            That seemed to do something. A soft click comes from the other locker.
    - command: >-
            While we're at it, enter command "sound horn"
      text: >-
            The console doesn't appear to recognize that command.
    - command: >-
            enter "open door".
      text: >-
            That got a response, but unfortunately the results weren't what Ruby had hoped for.
lines:
    - text: >-
            I just realized I messed up and the barrel appears closed in all these. Obviously, it should be open.
