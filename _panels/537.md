            <br/>Ruby asks the face who it is.<br/>The screen goes to static.<br/><br/>Ruby and Tom move on to explore the room.<br/><br/>This room is full of broken science equipment, including shattered beakers and tubes, a broken table in the southeast corner, and lots of spilled liquid. The room spells of chemical vapors.<br/>Tom can see something vaguely through the steel vent, but it's too sturdy to bash down by brute force.<br/>There are scraps and tatters of cloth at Tom's feet. They look like the remnants of a labcoat.<br/>By a very LARGE CABINET (which is locked with a chain and padlock), Ruby finds a SEVERED FOOT on the ground, with minimal blood.<br/>The door has no visible lock, but is wired to the MONITOR.<br/>Ruby pockets the HEAVY GLOVES she finds on the floor.<br/>Also of obvious note in this room is the ACCESS HATCH leading down, which is secured in place with some sort of STAFF.
