            Tom injects the LIQUID TRANQUILIZER but Bella only becomes angry. She explains that the systems she's hooked up to have replaced most of her body functions and will easily keep her conscious against the tranquilizer.<div class="linebreak"></div>She goes on to say that Tom and Ruby do not want the person in charge of security to be against them.<div class="linebreak"></div>She has asked nicely, she has helped them come this far, but now she is putting her foot down. She will lock doors, activate traps, and seal rooms if they persist. <div class="linebreak"></div>This time, she says, she's not going to give them a choice. They have to end her life now.<div class="linebreak"></div>There is no other option.
