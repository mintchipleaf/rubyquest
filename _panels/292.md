            OH FUCK YES! YOU'RE BACK.

            Greet tom, ask him if he has seen red, ask him how his eye/stomach are feeling.

            Tom says his stomach is feeling much better, but his eye is in severe pain.

            He doesn't know who "Red" is... but he does say that if you mean that person who keeps smiling, yes, he saw him.
            Red let Tom out of the room he was trapped in, just a few minutes ago. Tom came out to look for Ruby.

            Tom is glad to see Ruby. He says he thought she might be dead.
