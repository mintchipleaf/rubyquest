            <br/>Tom says his stomach is feeling much better, but his eye is in severe pain.<br/><br/>He doesn't know who "Red" is... but he does say that if you mean that person who keeps smiling, yes, he saw him.<br/>Red let Tom out of the room he was trapped in, just a few minutes ago. Tom came out to look for Ruby.<br/><br/>Tom is glad to see Ruby. He says he thought she might be dead.
