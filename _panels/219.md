            Inspect the drawer thing next to the scarecrow<br/>Try to RIP N TEAR scarecrow to see if there are items inside. Sounds strange, but so is a random scarecrow in a room. The whole strange-test hypothesis supports the fact that a useful item may be in such an innocuous location.<br/><br/>Tap DO NOT OPEN box. Speak to box to ask if anything is inside.

            [This is getting out of hand. We're going to end up with 50 threads tonight at this rate.<br/>Try refreshing before you post, to make sure the exact same thing hasn't been posted. Try to stay on subject. Maybe don't bother repeating a suggestion already posted 10 times. Delete your post if it's just a repeat. Anything. This flood of responses is too much to deal with and maintain any semblance of pacing, and as a result I have to cram as much action as possible into every panel and sacrifice detail and illustration of these actions just to keep up.<br/>PLEASE trim things down. <br/>Stop flooding the thread or I won't be able to continue.]<br/><br/>

            <br/>The crate is closed tightly. Ruby will never be able to open it with her bare hands.<br/><br/>
