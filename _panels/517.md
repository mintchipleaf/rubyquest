            Just one thing I wanted to add.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying the keycard from the hole in the wall does indeed work on the display case, as you all expected.<br/><br/>For the record, however:<br/>Smashing open the case would have sprung a lethal security system.<br/>Yes, it would have killed Tom. <br/><br/>Luckily a few smarter posters got the tool idea in first, but if they hadn't, I was ready to have him die.
