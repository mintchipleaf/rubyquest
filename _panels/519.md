            The large figure stands in the doorway, blocking Tom and Ruby's exit.<br/>[Archives and past installments are here: http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?tags=Ruby<br/>IRC discussion at irc.rizon.net , /join #rubyquest . Reactions, chatter, and theories can go here.<br/>To keep the thread free of clutter, please try to self-moderate. As always, try not to fill the thread with unnecessary or meaningless "me too" posts, seconds, or simply reactions. If you suggest something that others have already suggested multiple times, consider deleting your posts. However, mass-deletion of posts is not necessary and posting repeatedly for others to do this is unproductive. Please, just try to keep clutter down. The more comments there are, the slower the threads will go, and the less action there will be. Sorry these intros have gotten so long.<br/>Above all else, I hope you enjoy the thread.]
