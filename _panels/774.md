            Tom peers into the room ahead cautiously.<br/><br/>There is a HUGE CONSOLE on the north wall. There's also a door beside it, a maintenance hatch on the east wall beside which are scattered MANY NOTES. There is also a piece of strange GREEN WOOD lying against the HUGE CONSOLE. <br/>Finally, there appears to be an INTERCOM inset in the array of security monitoring equipment.
