            Woo Hoo!<br/>no to examine everything everywhere, and see what else we can unlock, lets start with the room we are in, examine the door, the bottom of the door, the symbol on the wall for any changes, and the thingy on the wall near the toolbox.

            The bottom of the door is warped and rusted, as if from water damage.<br/>Neither the symbol on the wall nor its inset cross-shaped socket have changed.<br/>The panel in the lower-right features five familiarly-labeled buttons.
