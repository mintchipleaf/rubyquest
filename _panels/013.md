            Ruby has slightly bigger concerns at the moment. Slightly. 
            But besides, there could be hidden cameras around!

            It would appear these controls are out of order. But even Ruby can tell this looks like an easy fix. Firstly, one of the wires is missing. Splicing it back together would be easy enough with the BARE LENGTH OF WIRE Ruby found. Then, there are connectors at the back of the control panel itself, so it will need to be screwed back into place.
