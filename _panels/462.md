            At the time I made the decision, split up had two votes, stay together had one.<div class="linebreak"></div>You're welcome to say fuck it and stop reading at any time if you're not 100% satisfied, but I really am doing the best I can especially under pressure and with such time limits.<div class="linebreak"></div>

            Ruby examines the room:<div class="linebreak"></div>There is a ladder leading up, with a sealed metal hatch at the top and on visible means of opening it.<div class="linebreak"></div>There are two doors to the north, both with a symbol above them. <div class="linebreak"></div>There is a FRAMED PICTURE on the wall, with some sort of illegible, archaic writing on it.<div class="linebreak"></div>To the east, there is a heavily-reinforced metal door with an inset card reader.<div class="linebreak"></div>There are two PLAQUES on the display case.<div class="linebreak"></div>The top one is illegible due to blood and rust. The second appears to be a request and/or warning label.<div class="linebreak"></div>A key card slot is set just underneath this second plaque.
