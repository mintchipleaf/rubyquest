            <br/>At the time I made the decision, split up had two votes, stay together had one.<br/>You're welcome to say fuck it and stop reading at any time if you're not 100% satisfied, but I really am doing the best I can especially under pressure and with such time limits.<br/><br/>

            <br/>Ruby examines the room:<br/>There is a ladder leading up, with a sealed metal hatch at the top and on visible means of opening it.<br/>There are two doors to the north, both with a symbol above them. <br/>There is a FRAMED PICTURE on the wall, with some sort of illegible, archaic writing on it.<br/>To the east, there is a heavily-reinforced metal door with an inset card reader.<br/><br/>There are two PLAQUES on the display case.<br/>The top one is illegible due to blood and rust. The second appears to be a request and/or warning label.<br/>A key card slot is set just underneath this second plaque.
