      text: >-
            Tom fills his SYRINGE with LIQUID TRANQUILIZER. He's got several doses worth in there now!<br/>Still, he considers how much good it would do against a behemoth like Ace, should he show up again.<br/>There appear to be three schools of thought on the fleshy locker. Should Tom:<br/>Cut the growths sealing the locker with the scalpel?<br/>Retrieve the fleshy growth from the jar downstairs and use it with the locker?<br/>Inject the growths with tranquilizer?
