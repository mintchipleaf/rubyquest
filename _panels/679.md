            Tom fills his SYRINGE with LIQUID TRANQUILIZER. He's got several doses worth in there now!<div class="linebreak"></div>Still, he considers how much good it would do against a behemoth like Ace, should he show up again.<div class="linebreak"></div>There appear to be three schools of thought on the fleshy locker. Should Tom:<div class="linebreak"></div>Cut the growths sealing the locker with the scalpel?<div class="linebreak"></div>Retrieve the fleshy growth from the jar downstairs and use it with the locker?<div class="linebreak"></div>Inject the growths with tranquilizer?
