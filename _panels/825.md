            Artistic oversight.

            Tom and Ruby escape from Ace's lair in cold storage. They seal the area behind them, but knowing Ace, it won't hold him for long. Whatever they're going to do, they had better do it FAST. Ace is clearly on a mission and this facility will not be safe for them for very much longer. 

            Tom's MANLY PHYSIQUE allows him to carry the prisoner with relative ease, but his move speed is still reduced. Perhaps things would move faster if he and Ruby split up.

            Remember, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE! 
            Go!
