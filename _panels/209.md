            [All I'm saying is that with so many replies it can be a bit difficult to keep up, let alone keep things orderly.<div class="linebreak"></div>Just try to avoid useless comments that consist only of reactions (e.g. OH SHIT, or WAT.), or things like just seconding a suggestion that's already been made (e.g. "This.")<div class="linebreak"></div>In the long run, it'll make things easier on me. I'm not asking you to shut up, just don't post for the sake of posting and try to keep the thread trimmed as best you can. Thanks!]<div class="linebreak"></div>
